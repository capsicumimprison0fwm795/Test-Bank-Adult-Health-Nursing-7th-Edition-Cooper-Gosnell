**Chapter 3: Care of the Patient with an Integumentary Disorder**
**MULTIPLE CHOICE**

1. What should the nurse do when administering a therapeutic bath to a patient who has severe pruritus?
2. a. Use Burow’s solution to help promote healing
3. b. Rub the skin briskly to decrease pruritus
4. c. Limit bathing to 3 times a week
5. d. Ensure that bath area is at least 85 degrees and dehumidified

6. ANS: A
7. Pruritus is responsible for most of the discomfort. Wet dressings and using Burow’s solution help promote the healing process. A cool environment with increased humidity decreases the pruritus. Give daily baths with an application to cleanse the skin.

11. 2. A frail, older adult home health patient who had chickenpox as a child has been exposed to varicella (chickenpox) several days ago. What should the nurse do?
    3. a. Assess frequently for herpes zoster
    4. b. Be aware of the patient’s immunity to chickenpox
    5. c. Encourage the patient to have a pneumonia vaccine
    6. d. Arrange for the patient to receive gamma globulin
   
    7. ANS: A
    8. Herpes zoster is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox (Herpes varicella). The greatest risk occurs to patients who have a lowered resistance to infection, such as those on chemotherapy, aging, or receiving large doses of prednisone, in whom the disease could be fatal because of the patient’s compromised immune system.

    12. 3. A patient has herpes zoster (shingles) and is being treated with acyclovir (Zovirax). What should the nurse do when administering this drug?
        4. a. Apply lightly, being careful not to completely cover the lesion
        5. b. After application, wrap in warm wet dressings
        6. c. Use gloves
        7. d. Rub medication into lesions
       
        8. ANS: C
        9. The topical application requires that the nurse uses gloves, completely covers the lesion gently, then leaves it open to the air.

        13. 4. A child has been sent to the school nurse with pruritus and honey-colored crusts on the lower lip and chin. The nurse believes these lesions most likely are:
            5. a. chickenpox.
            6. b. impetigo.
            7. c. shingles.
            8. d. herpes simplex type I.
           
            9. ANS: B
            10. Impetigo is seen at all ages, but is particularly common in children. The crust is honey-colored and easily removed and is associated with pruritus. The disease is highly contagious and spreads by contact.

            14. 5. A school nurse assesses a child who has an erythematous circular patch of vesicles on her scalp with alopecia and complains of pain and pruritus. Why would the nurse use a Woods lamp?
                6. a. To dry out the lesions
                7. b. To reduce the pruritus
                8. c. To kill the fungus
                9. d. To cause fluorescence of the infected hairs
               
                10. ANS: D
                11. Tinea capitis is commonly known as ringworm of the scalp. Microsporum audouinii is the major fungal pathogen. The use of the diagnostic Woods lamp causes the infected hairs to turn a brilliant blue green.

                15. 6. A patient, age 46, reports to his physician’s office with urticaria with elevated lesions that are white in the center with a pale red border on hands and arms. He says, “It itches like crazy.” Which type of lesion would the nurse include in her documentation?
                    7. a. Macules
                    8. b. Plaques
                    9. c. Wheals
                    10. d. Vesicles
                   
                    11. ANS: C
                    12. Urticaria is the term applied to the presence of wheals or hives in an allergic reaction commonly caused by drugs, food, insect bites, inhalants, emotional stress, or exposure to heat or cold. The lesions are elevated with a white center and a pale red border.

                    16. 7. The home health nurse assessing skin lesions uses the PQRST mnemonic as a guide. What does the S in this guide indicate?
                        8. a. Severity of the symptoms
                        9. b. Site of the lesions
                        10. c. Symptomatology of the lesions
                        11. d. Surface area of the lesions
                       
                        12. ANS: A
                        13. The mnemonic PQRST stands for Provocative factors (causes), Quantity, Region of the body, Severity of the symptoms, Time (length of time the disorder has been present).

                            9. a. Avoid alcoholic beverages
                            10. b. Drink at least 1000 mL of fluid daily
                            11. c. Use dependable birth control to avoid pregnancy
                            12. d. Avoid exposure to the sun
                           
                            13. ANS: C
                            14. Accutane has a destructive effect on fetal development. Dependable birth control is important to avoid a pregnancy.

                                15. Keloids, which originate in scars, are hard and shiny and are seen more often in African Americans than in whites.

                                19. 10. A patient, age 37, sustained partial- and full-thickness burns to 26% of the body surface area. When would the greatest fluid loss resulting from the burns occur?
                                    11. a. Within 12 hours after burn trauma
                                    12. b. 24 to 36 hours after burn trauma
                                    13. c. 24 to 48 hours after burn trauma

                                    16. In a burn injury, usually the greatest fluid loss occurs within the first 12 hours.

                                    20. 11. Most of the deaths from burn trauma in the emergent phase that require a referral to a burn center result from:
                                        12. a. infection.
                                        13. b. arrhythmias with cardiac arrest.
                                        14. c. hypovolemic shock and renal failure.

                                        16. ANS: C
                                        17. Hypovolemic shock is frequently lethal in the emergent period of a severe burn because of the transfer of fluids into the interstitial tissue from the circulating volume.

                                        21. 12. The nurse takes into consideration that carbon monoxide intoxication secondary to smoke inhalation is often fatal because carbon monoxide:
                                            13. a. binds with hemoglobin in place of oxygen.
                                            14. b. interferes with oxygen intake.
                                            15. c. is a respiratory depressant.
                                            16. d. is a toxic agent.
                                           
                                            17. ANS: A
                                            18. Carbon monoxide poisoning is likely if the patient has been in an enclosed area. Carbon monoxide displaces oxygen by binding with hemoglobin.

                                                14. a. The extent and depth of the burn
